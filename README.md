# Pauxx Blogs

Pauxx Blogs is a client that allows for you to view my blogs straight from your console.

Originally this was supposed to be testing with ncurses, but then I just made an http class from libcurl.

## Building from source

Grab the repo via git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Paxxous/pauxx-console.git
cd pauxx-console
```

And then compile and run via the makefile

```sh
Make relase
./bin/main
```
